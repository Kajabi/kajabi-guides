# Getting started as a developer at Kajabi

Here's a list of things good for you to do your first few days at Kajabi.
The list also helps us keep track of getting you up and running.

* Join us for your first daily standup!  It's typically around 9:15am.
* Get your user@kajabi.com email access.  Jonathan can provide this.
* Check your Kajabi mail. It will contain logins for payroll, HR, etc, systems.
* Ensure you have Two Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your GitHub account.
* Get added to our organization on GitHub and the Kajabi Core Team.  We will use the
  GitHub user you prefer and don't need to create a new one for you.
* Pull the Kajabi/kajabi-products branch and get it up and running.  If you have
  trouble ask another dev, then update the readme and put in a PR.
* Skim over the code for kajabi-products.  Especially pay attention to the directories.
  in app/ and ask if you'd like clarification on things.
* Get password repository access from Brendon.
* Get IAM credentials from Brendon.
* If you don't have a Heroku account, set one up at heroku.com. Ensure you have 2FA enabled.
* Get added as a collaborator to our Heroku applications.
* Test that you have `heroku console` access to our applications.  Ask another developer
  for the list to try.
* Get added to honeybadger.io for exception monitoring
* Get added on SemaphoreApp test run reporting
* Read the other guides here.
* Get your first feature from GitHub issues.  We'll help you to hopefully get your code
  in production your first week.  Satisfaction!
