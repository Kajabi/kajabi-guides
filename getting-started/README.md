# Getting started as a developer at Kajabi

Here's a list of things good for you to do your first few days at Kajabi.
The list also helps us keep track of getting you up and running.

* Get your user@kajabi.com email access.
* Check your Kajabi email. It will contain logins for Gusto, 1Password, and Slack.
  If any of those invitations are missing or expired, contact Elissa Berg at eberg@kajabi.com.
* Ensure you have Two Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your GitHub account.
* Get added to our organization on GitHub and the Kajabi Core Team. We will use the
  GitHub user you prefer and don't need to create a new one for you.
* Pull the [Kajabi/kajabi-products](https://github.com/Kajabi/kajabi-products)
  repo and get it up and running. If you have trouble ask another dev,
  then update the readme and put in a PR.
* Skim over the code for `kajabi-products`. Especially pay attention to the directories
  in `app/` and ask if you'd like clarification on things.
* Get password repository access from Brendon.
* Get IAM credentials from Brendon.
* If you don't have a Heroku account, set one up at heroku.com. Ensure you have 2FA enabled.
* Get added as a collaborator to our Heroku applications.
* Test that you have `heroku console` access to our applications. Ask another developer
  for the list to try.
* Get added to Honeybadger.io for exception monitoring
* Get added on Semaphore App for test run reporting
* Read the other guides in this repo.
* Get your first feature from GitHub issues. We'll help you to hopefully get your code
  in production your first week. Satisfaction!
