# Titles for programmers

## Note, this is currently WIP

We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of developers at Kajabi.
These criteria are not exhaustive, and they are not mere checklists.
They are a guidance to having an individualized discussion about career progression.

It should also be noted that these criteria chiefly examine the scope of work someone is
capable of tackling independently. In addition to that assessment, we also look at the
quality of the execution itself.

Progression of these levels is usually achieved after reaching the level. We tend to
have discussions like "you are meeting the requirements of a Developer now, so it is
time for you to move you to that from a Junior Developer".

  of basic MVC, ActiveRecord, etc.
